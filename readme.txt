All code and data that is required to run for HW2 is available at
https://github.com/bitsbuffer/RandomisedOptimization

To set environment, use pip to install all packages using
pip install -r requirements.txt

All the required data is avaialble in the dataset directoy

For optimization problems, there are 6 file,
3 files for parameter tuning for 3 datasets
3 files for running final experiment

Files: 4PeaksTuning.py, TSPTuning.py and 8QueensTuning.py contain code for parameter tuning
Files: 4Peaks.py, 8Queens.py, TSP.py contain code for runnning final experiment
Files: BorutaBNPParibas.py contain code for feature selection using Boruta algorithm
Files: NeuralNetwork.py contains code for running all experiments for neural netowrks
